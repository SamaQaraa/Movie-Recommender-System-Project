use the dataset attached in this folder to build "Hybrid Recommender System"

build your OWN Recommender in you algorithm .. it is a matter of creativity and design

use any approach you choose "Attached in any form [word - blackboard - Falafel Paper]" that I can read and understand your proposed design

IT IS a MUST in deliverables to "Attach your design" بيني و بينك احسن طريقة للفهم هي انك تصور فيديو تشرح فيه الفكرة اللى هتنفذها هيفيدك جدا في التفكير

The full code implementation is a Server-Client app with pyQt5 Lib for client GUI


Deliverables : 
A)GITHUB REPO LINK:
1- full readme file [project desc - env creation - dependencies - usage ..]
2- requirements file
3- Scratch python notebook
4- a good structured files and folders, clean coded


B)DESIGN PROPOSAL IN ANY FORM

HINT (1) : First, Think in project as a pipeline, Draw it, its all stages, [data preparing, models choosing, inference stage, recommendation ranking ..] . Then, Start to implement.

HINT (2) : Take in consideration REC-SYS EVALUATION METRICS .. Show it and highlight it. you can find the code in course material, JUST USE IT TO EVALUATE your proposed Recommender system.
